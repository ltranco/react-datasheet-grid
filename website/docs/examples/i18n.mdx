# Internationalization

Their are three part of DSG that involve i18n, row numbers, the "Add" button, and the context menu. Each one is
customizable to you needs.

## Row numbers

Simply override the component of the [gutter column](../api-reference/props#guttercolumn).
You can then display anything based on the [rowIndex](../api-reference/cell-components#rowindex) prop.

```tsx
return (
  <DataSheetGrid
    gutterColumn={{
      component: <CustomRowNumberComponent />
    }}
  />
)
```

## Add button and context menu
Both can be replaced [with your own component](../api-reference/props#customizable-components).
